:::caution[Error: "Are you missing an assembly reference?"]

This guide addresses the common error on MacOS where the message “are you missing an assembly reference?” appears when trying to run a SplashKit project. This is often due to a naming conflict in the project setup.

:::

## Problem

When creating or running a SplashKit project, an error message stating "are you missing an assembly reference?" may appear. This can happen if the project is named "SplashKit," which conflicts with internal references.

## Solution

To resolve this error, ensure your project name is different from "SplashKit."

<Steps>

1. **Rename Your Project Folder**

    Make sure the folder where you create your SplashKit project does not have the name “SplashKit.”

    Choose a unique name for the folder, as the project name is automatically derived from it.

2. **Recreate the Project (if needed)**

    If the error persists, try recreating the project in a new folder with a different name to avoid any cached references to the previous setup.

</Steps>

Following these steps should eliminate the naming conflict, allowing your SplashKit project to compile and run without the assembly reference error.
