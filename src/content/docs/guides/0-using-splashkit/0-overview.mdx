Here is a basic overview of how to compile and run SplashKit programs in C++, C# and python.

<Tabs syncKey="code-language">
  <TabItem label="C++">
  To compile C++ SplashKit code, you will use the following command (assuming the code file is named `program.cpp`):

  ```shell
  g++ program.cpp -l SplashKit -o test_program
  ```

  Then you can run the program with:

  ```shell
  ./test_program
  ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="C#">
  To run C# SplashKit code with dotnet, you will need to first run the command below:

  ```shell
  dotnet add package SplashKit
  ```

  This will add the SplashKit NuGet package, to link the SplashKit SDK to your project.

  Then you can run the program using:

  ```shell
  dotnet run
  ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Python">
  To run SplashKit python code, you will use the following command (assuming the code file is named `program.py`):

  ```shell
  skm python3 program.py
  ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
