:::caution[Issue:]

When trying to use `code .` in the terminal, you may encounter the error `zsh: command not found: code`, indicating that the path to the Visual Studio Code 'code' command is not included in your PATH.

## Solution(s)

### 1. Ensure Visual Studio Code is in Applications folder

Check your "Applications" folder contains the "Visual Studio Code" app.

If it is missing from this folder, find where it is currently located and drag the file into the Applications folder.

---

### 2. Add the 'code' path to your PATH using terminal

<Steps>

1. If you are having issues getting the `code` command to work, an alternative method you can try is to run the following command (adapted from the [Alternative Manual Instructions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac#_alternative-manual-instructions) section).

    ```zsh
    echo "export PATH=\"\$PATH:/Applications/Visual Studio Code.app/Contents/Resources/app/bin\"" >> ~/.zshrc
    ```

2. **Apply Changes**

    Save the `.zshrc` Reload the `.zshrc` paths with the following command to apply changes immediately:

     ```shell
     source ~/.zshrc
     ```

</Steps>

---

### 3. Add the 'code' path to your PATH manually

<Steps>

1. **Locate Your `.zshrc` File**

    The `.zshrc` file is located in your home directory at `~/Users/(your username)/`.

    If you don’t see it, press **Shift + Command + . (dot)** to toggle hidden files visibility in Finder.

2. **Identify Your Username (Optional)**
  
    To ensure you’re in the correct directory, you can use the `whoami` command in Terminal to check your username:

     ```shell
     whoami
     ```

3. **Add VS Code to PATH**
  
    Open the `.zshrc` file with a text editor and add the following line at the end to include the Visual Studio Code path:

     ```shell
     export PATH="$PATH:/Applications/Visual Studio Code.app/Contents/Resources/app/bin"
     ```

4. **Apply Changes**

    Save the `.zshrc` file and then reload it with the following command to apply changes immediately:

     ```shell
     source ~/.zshrc
     ```

</Steps>

### 4. Update permissions

If you are still having issues, try following the steps on the [3. .zshrc permission issues](/troubleshoot/macos/mac-issue-3) page first, then come back to repeat the steps above.
