:::caution[`brew cask install dotnet-sdk` Command Not Working]

This guide addresses issues on MacOS where the command `brew cask install dotnet-sdk` fails. The instructions below provide the correct command and alternative installation options for the .NET SDK.

:::

## Problem

Running `brew cask install dotnet-sdk` on MacOS returns an error, as `cask` is no longer required for this command in recent versions of Homebrew.

## Solution

### Corrected Command

The updated command for installing .NET SDK is:

```shell
brew install dotnet-sdk --cask
```

This command installs the latest compatible version of the .NET SDK using Homebrew. Make sure Homebrew is updated by running `brew update` before trying the installation.

### Alternative Installation

If Homebrew is not an option or you encounter further issues, you can download the .NET SDK directly from the Microsoft website:

<Steps>

1. Go to the [.NET SDK 7.0 download page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/7.0).
2. Select the macOS installer link for your system architecture:
   - **Arm64** for Apple Silicon (M1 and newer chips).
   - **x64** for Intel-based Macs.

</Steps>

Download and install using the installer provided on the website.

**Note:** Make sure to choose the correct architecture for your Mac model to avoid compatibility issues.

This should resolve issues with installing .NET SDK on MacOS via Homebrew or the Microsoft website.
