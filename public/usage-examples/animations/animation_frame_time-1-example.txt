Animation Frame Time — How long has the animation been on the current frame

Short example showing how to read the amount of time spent in the current frame (FrameTime).

:::note
This example uses the `explosion.txt` resource to demonstrate frame durations. The verification runner parses the script and reports the duration for the first frame of the `explosion` animation.
