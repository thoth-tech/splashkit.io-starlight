:::caution[`error while loading shared libraries: libSplashKit.so`]

This guide addresses the error where `libSplashKit.so` cannot be found when attempting to run a SplashKit program on Linux. This issue typically occurs when the system cannot locate the SplashKit library path, especially if recent changes were made to `bash` or `zsh` profiles.

:::

## Problem

When trying to run a SplashKit program, you may see an error indicating that `libSplashKit.so` cannot be found. This is often due to missing or incorrect paths in the shell profile or system library configuration.

## Solutions

Follow these steps to ensure your shell profile and system library paths are configured correctly.

### Step 1: Update Your Shell Profile (`~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`)

**For Bash Users**:

<Steps>

1. Open the `~/.bashrc` file:

    ```shell
    nano ~/.bashrc
    ```

2. Add the following line near the end of the file to include SplashKit in your PATH:

    ```shell
    export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.splashkit"
    ```

3. Save and close the file, then apply the changes:

    ```shell
    source ~/.bashrc
    ```

</Steps>

**For Zsh Users**:

<Steps>

1. Open the `~/.zshrc` file:

    ```shell
    nano ~/.zshrc
    ```

2. Add the following line near the end of the file:

    ```shell
    export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.splashkit"
    ```

3. Save and close the file, then update your profile:

    ```shell
    source ~/.zshrc
    ```

</Steps>

### Step 2: Update the System Library Path

To ensure the system can locate `libSplashKit.so`, add `/usr/local/lib` to the systemâ€™s library path:

```shell
sudo ldconfig /usr/local/lib
```

This command configures the system to recognize libraries in `/usr/local/lib`, ensuring that `libSplashKit.so` is accessible to your applications.

Following these steps should resolve the `libSplashKit.so` not found error and allow you to successfully run SplashKit programs on Linux.
