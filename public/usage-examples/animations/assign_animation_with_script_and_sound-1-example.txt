Assign Animation (with script + sound) — attach an animation and optionally play the first-frame sound

This example shows how to use `assign_animation` with a script and the `with_sound` flag. When `with_sound` is true, the animation will play the sound effect attached to the animation's first frame (if one exists in the script).
