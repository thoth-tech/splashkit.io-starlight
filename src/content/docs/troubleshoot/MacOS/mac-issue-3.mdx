:::caution[`ln -s /usr/local/share/dotnet/dotnet /usr/local/bin` Command Not Working]

This guide provides a solution for MacOS users encountering issues when trying to create a symbolic link for .NET using the command `ln -s /usr/local/share/dotnet/dotnet /usr/local/bin`.

:::

## Problem

When running `ln -s /usr/local/share/dotnet/dotnet /usr/local/bin`, some users receive an error message or find that the command does not work as expected, often due to permission issues or existing conflicting files.

## Solution

To resolve this issue, use the following command, which includes `sudo` to grant temporary system (root) privileges:

```shell
sudo ln -s /usr/local/share/dotnet/dotnet /usr/local/bin
```

*The `sudo` command is used here to give necessary permissions.*

<Steps>

1. **Enter Your Password:** After running the command above, you will be prompted to enter your password. Type it in and press **Enter**.

2. **If You Encounter a Permission Denied Error:**
  
   If you receive a “`zsh: permission denied: dotnet`” error, it’s likely due to an existing file conflict in the `/usr/local/bin` directory.

3. **Delete the Existing Dotnet File:**

    Open Finder and navigate to the “`/usr/local/bin`” folder:
    - Click “**Go**” at the top of the screen.
    - Select “**Go to Folder…**” and enter `/usr/local/bin` as the folder path.
    - In the `/usr/local/bin` folder, locate and delete any existing `dotnet` file.

4. **Re-run the Command:**

    Open a new Terminal window and re-enter the command:

    ```shell
    sudo ln -s /usr/local/share/dotnet/dotnet /usr/local/bin
    ```

</Steps>

Following these steps should successfully create the symbolic link, allowing you to use the `dotnet` command from any terminal session.
