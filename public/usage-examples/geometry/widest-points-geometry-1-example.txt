Program: Widest Points on a Circle Along a Vector

Description:
This program calculates and displays the two widest points on a circle along a vector that extends from the circle’s center to the mouse position (the external point). As you move the mouse, the direction vector is updated, and the widest points are recalculated in real time.

How it works:
- The circle is drawn at the center of the window.
- The current mouse position is shown as a blue dot.
- A vector (green line) from the circle’s center to the mouse position represents the direction.
- The two widest points on the circle along this vector are calculated and drawn as red dots.
- Red lines are drawn from the center of the circle to each widest point.
- The coordinates of the mouse position and both widest points are displayed on the screen.

Purpose:
This visualization helps users understand how to find the two points on a circle’s edge that are farthest apart along a given direction vector.

How to use:
- Move your mouse inside the window.
- The program will automatically update the direction vector and show the corresponding widest points on the circle.
