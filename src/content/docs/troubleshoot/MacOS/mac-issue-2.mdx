:::caution[Issue:]

You get an error message when running the `dotnet run` command (after running the `dotnet add package SplashKit` command), which might look something like this:

![dotnet run not working with .NET 9](/images/troubleshoot/macos/dotnet-9-issue.png)

## Solution(s)

There are a few ways to resolve this issue:

### 1: Update SplashKit

<Steps>

1. Run the following command in a new terminal window:

    ```shell
    skm update
    ```

    Make sure to check if there are any errors in the output such as permissions issues.

2. You may also need to run:

    ```shell
    skm global install
    ```

    This command is usually run when using the update command above, but running it again won't cause issues.

3. To test if this has been resolved:

    Create a new project folder and a new C# project.

</Steps>

### 2: Use `skm` commands

You can use `skm` at the start of any compiling/building commands, or when running C# programs.

For example, you can use the following commands:

- `skm dotnet build`: compile/bui;d the project in the current working directory.
- `skm dotnet run`: build if needed, then run/execute your program.
