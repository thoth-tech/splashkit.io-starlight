This example demonstrates how to use the base64_decode function in SplashKit.

The program takes a Base64-encoded string (e.g. "SGVsbG8gU3BsYXNoS2l0")
and decodes it back into its original plain text ("Hello SplashKit").

This is useful when converting serialized or encoded data back into a readable format.
