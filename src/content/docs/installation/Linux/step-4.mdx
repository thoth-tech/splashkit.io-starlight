SplashKit supports multiple programming languages, each with its own set of tools. Follow the instructions below to install the required tools for your language of choice.

## Language-Specific Installations

### C# (.NET)

To develop with C# in SplashKit, you’ll need to install .NET. Installation methods vary by Linux distribution:

  To install .NET SDK on Arch:

  ```shell
  yay -S dotnet-sdk
  ```

  To install only the .NET runtime (for running .NET apps without development tools):

  ```shell
  yay -S dotnet-runtime
  ```

</details>

If the .NET installer does not automatically update your shell profile, you can manually add it:

Open your `~/.bashrc` file:

```shell
nano ~/.bashrc
```

Add the following lines near the end:

```shell
export DOTNET_ROOT=$HOME/.dotnet
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.dotnet
```

Apply the changes:

```shell
source ~/.bashrc
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="zsh">
Open your `.zshrc` file:

```shell
nano ~/.zshrc
```

Add the following lines near the end:

```shell
export DOTNET_ROOT=$HOME/.dotnet
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.dotnet
```

Apply the changes:

```shell
source ~/.zshrc
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### C++

For C++, you should already have the necessary tools if you have a standard Linux development environment. No additional setup is required specifically for SplashKit.

---

### Python

Most Linux distributions include Python pre-installed. If Python isn’t installed, or if you need additional Python tools, follow the steps below.

<Steps>

1. **Installing Python**

    Install Python 3 and `pip` (Python package installer) using the following commands based on your Linux distribution:

    <Tabs syncKey="linux-distro">
    <TabItem label="Ubuntu/Debian">

    ```shell
    sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
    ```

    </TabItem>

    <TabItem label="Arch">
    <Tabs syncKey="package-manager">
    <TabItem label="With pacman">

    ```shell
    sudo pacman -S python python-pip
    ```

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="With yay">

    ```shell
    yay -S python python-pip
    ```

    </TabItem>
    </Tabs>
    </TabItem>

    <TabItem label="Fedora">

    ```shell
    sudo dnf install python3 python3-pip
    ```

    </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

   ---

2. **Verify Installation (Optional)**

    To confirm that Python and `pip` are successfully installed, check the versions:

    ```shell
    python3 --version
    pip3 --version
    ```

    Both commands should output version information if the installation was successful.

</Steps>

### Other Languages

Support for other languages such as Rust and Pascal are coming soon.
