:::caution[Linux: Error While Running `skm global install` Command]

This guide addresses the error where `libSplashKit.so` is not found when trying to run a SplashKit program on Linux using the `skm global install` command. This issue often occurs when `bash` or `zsh` cannot locate the SplashKit library path.

:::

## Problem

If you receive an error when attempting to install SplashKit using `skm global install`, it’s likely because the system cannot locate the necessary SplashKit library files. Adding these paths manually can resolve the issue.

## Solutions

Follow these steps to update your shell profiles and system library path to include SplashKit.

### Update Your Shell Profile (`~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`)

**For Bash Users**:

<Steps>

1. Open your `~/.bashrc` file:

    ```shell
    nano ~/.bashrc
    ```

2. Add the following line near the end of the file:

    ```shell
    export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.splashkit"
    ```

3. Save and close the file, then update your profile:

    ```shell
    source ~/.bashrc
    ```

</Steps>

**For Zsh Users**:

<Steps>

1. Open your `~/.zshrc` file:

    ```shell
    nano ~/.zshrc
    ```

2. Add the following line near the end of the file:

    ```shell
    export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.splashkit"
    ```

3. Save and close the file, then update your profile:

    ```shell
    source ~/.zshrc
    ```

</Steps>

### Update the System Library Path

To make sure your system can access the SplashKit library files, add `/usr/local/lib` to the system’s library path:

```shell
sudo ldconfig /usr/local/lib
```

This command will configure your system to recognise libraries in `/usr/local/lib`, allowing SplashKit applications to locate `libSplashKit.so` as needed.

Following these steps should resolve the `libSplashKit.so` not found error and ensure that SplashKit can be successfully installed and run on Linux.
