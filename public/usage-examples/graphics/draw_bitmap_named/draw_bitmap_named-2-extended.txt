#### Hello World! This is SplashKit!

The following code shows a fun example of using [Draw Bitmap](/api/graphics/#draw-bitmap-3) to create a fun animation/video. This example was created by someone that grew up as a "horse girl" and is reminded of the Saddle Club intro theme song (played in this example) every time she creates a new "hello world" program.
