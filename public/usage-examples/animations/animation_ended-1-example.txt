Animation Ended — Check whether an animation has finished

Example showing how to check when an Animation has ended. Uses the `explosion.txt` resource which contains frames where some have no `next` frame (end) and others loop.

:::note
The verification runner below parses `explosion.txt` and determines whether a given animation's frames include a terminal frame (no `next` field).
