:::caution[`zsh: command not found: skm`]

This guide helps resolve the error `zsh: command not found: skm` on MacOS. This issue occurs when the SplashKit path is not correctly set in the `.zshrc` file.

:::

## Problem

When trying to use `skm` in the terminal, you may encounter the error `zsh: command not found: skm`, indicating that the `.splashkit` directory is not included in your PATH.

## Solution

To resolve this, add the `.splashkit` folder to your `.zshrc` file. Follow the steps below:

<Steps>

1. **Locate Your `.zshrc` File**

    The `.zshrc` file is located in your home directory at `~/Users/(your username)/`.

    If you don’t see it, press **Shift + Command + . (dot)** to toggle hidden files visibility in Finder.

2. **Identify Your Username (Optional)**
  
    To ensure you’re in the correct directory, you can use the `whoami` command in Terminal to check your username:

     ```shell
     whoami
     ```

3. **Add SplashKit to PATH**
  
    Open the `.zshrc` file with a text editor and add the following line at the end to include the SplashKit path:

     ```shell
     export PATH="$HOME/.splashkit:$PATH"
     ```

4. **Optional: Add .NET Path to PATH**

    For .NET compatibility, add this line to your `.zshrc` file as well:

     ```shell
     export PATH="/usr/local/share/dotnet:$PATH"
     ```

5. **Optional: Enable VS Code from Terminal**

    To enable the `code .` command for opening Visual Studio Code from the terminal, add the following line:

     ```shell
     export PATH="$PATH:/Applications/Visual Studio Code.app/Contents/Resources/app/bin"
     ```

6. **Apply Changes**

    Save the `.zshrc` file and then reload it with the following command to apply changes immediately:

     ```shell
     source ~/.zshrc
     ```

</Steps>

After completing these steps, your terminal should recognize the `skm` command, and you should be able to use SplashKit as expected.
