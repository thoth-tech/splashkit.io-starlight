Animation Entered Frame — Detect when an animation moves to a new frame

Short example that shows how to check whether an Animation "entered" a new frame on its last update.

:::note
This example uses `explosion.txt` resources where frames transition over time. The verification runner checks the script to see if updates will cause frame transitions for the animation (i.e. more than one frame / a next frame relationship).
