Description:
This program is a graphical application that tracks the position of a circle on the screen. The circle's position is updated to the mouse's position within a window. The program calculates and displays the closest point on a line from the moving circle.

Components:
1. Circle:
   - A circle is drawn at the current mouse position.
   - The circle has a radius of 50 pixels.

2. Line:
   - A line is drawn from a starting point (200, 100) to an ending point (600, 500).

3. Closest Point Calculation:
   - The program calculates the closest point on the line to the circle's current position using vector projection.
   - The calculated point is highlighted on the screen in green.

Steps:
1. A `CircleTracker` class is implemented to manage the circle and line.
2. A method `Run()` initializes the window and runs a loop, constantly updating the circle's position to the mouse's location.
3. The closest point on the line is calculated in each frame using the `GetClosestPointOnLine` method.
4. The program continuously redraws the line, the circle, and the closest point on the line.

Details:
- The program uses SplashKit for window management, drawing shapes, and handling mouse events.
- The closest point on the line is determined through a projection of the circleâ€™s position onto the line, ensuring the point lies within the line segment.

Key Concepts:
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Vector Mathematics (for projection calculation)
- Real-time graphical rendering
