Animation Index — Find an animation by name in a script

Demonstrates how to search an AnimationScript for a named animation identifier and return its index.

:::note
This example uses the `kermit.txt` script which contains identifiers like `WalkFront` and `Dance` used in the guides. The verification runner looks up the name and prints the index found.
