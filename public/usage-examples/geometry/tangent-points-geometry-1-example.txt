This program calculates and displays the two tangent points from an external point (the mouse position) to a circle using SplashKit.

- Move the mouse outside the circle to see the tangent points.
- The program draws the circle, the mouse position, both tangent points, and lines from the mouse to each tangent point.
- The coordinates of the tangent points and the mouse are displayed at the top left of the window.
- Works in SplashKit for Python, C# (OOP & top-level), and C++ (see source for each).
