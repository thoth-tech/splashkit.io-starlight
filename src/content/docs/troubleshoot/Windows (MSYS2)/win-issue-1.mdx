:::caution[`bash <(curl -s ... install-scripts/skm-install.sh)` Command Does Nothing]

This guide provides solutions for Windows users who encounter issues when trying to run the install script command from the main page. This command may not execute as expected due to firewall or connection issues.

## Problem

On Windows, running `bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splashkit/skm/master/install-scripts/skm-install.sh)` may result in no output or action in the terminal, often due to network settings or restrictions.
