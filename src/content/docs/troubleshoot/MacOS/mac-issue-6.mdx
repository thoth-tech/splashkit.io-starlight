## Solution(s)

### 1. Download and install .NET (version 8 or 9)

Download and install [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) if you haven't already.

Then close and reopen your terminal to test the command again.

### 2. Add the 'dotnet' path to your PATH using terminal

<Steps>

1. To add 'dotnet' to your PATH, run the following command:

    ```zsh
    echo "export PATH=\"/usr/local/share/dotnet:\$PATH\"" >> ~/.zshrc
    ```

2. **Apply Changes**

    Save the `.zshrc` Reload the `.zshrc` paths with the following command to apply changes immediately:

     ```shell
     source ~/.zshrc
     ```

</Steps>

### 3. Add the 'dotnet' path to your PATH manually

<Steps>

1. **Locate Your `.zshrc` File**

    The `.zshrc` file is located in your home directory at `~/Users/(your username)/`.

    If you don’t see it, press **Shift + Command + . (dot)** to toggle hidden files visibility in Finder.

2. **Identify Your Username (Optional)**
  
    To ensure you’re in the correct directory, you can use the `whoami` command in Terminal to check your username:

     ```shell
     whoami
     ```

3. **Add .NET Path to PATH**

    For .NET compatibility, add this line to your `.zshrc` file as well:

     ```shell
     export PATH="/usr/local/share/dotnet:$PATH"
     ```

4. **Apply Changes**

    Save the `.zshrc` file and then reload it with the following command to apply changes immediately:

     ```shell
     source ~/.zshrc
     ```

</Steps>

### 4. Update permissions

If you are still having issues, try following the steps on the [3. .zshrc permission issues](/troubleshoot/macos/mac-issue-3) page first, then come back to repeat the steps above.
