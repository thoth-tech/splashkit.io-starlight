Description:- In this task, I built end-to-end, self-contained examples that showcase SplashKit’s networking API—especially the read_message function—across C++, Python, and C#. In C++, I implemented both a minimal client–server demo and a standalone client script, plus a graphics variant that renders incoming text in a SplashKit window. The Python version mirrors these flows using the library’s Python bindings. For C#, I delivered both top-level and OOP-style programs, each accompanied by a fully configured .NET 6 project file referencing the official SplashKit NuGet package. Every example includes precise compile/run commands, throw-away TCP server recipes (via Python or netcat), and troubleshooting notes for linker flags and package references, ensuring smooth, beginner-friendly demonstrations of read_message.
