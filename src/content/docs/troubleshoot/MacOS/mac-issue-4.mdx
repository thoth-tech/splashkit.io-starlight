:::caution[`System.DllNotFoundException unable to load DLL splashkit.dll`]

This guide provides solutions for MacOS users encountering the `System.DllNotFoundException` error when attempting to run programs that rely on `splashkit.dll`. This issue is often related to operating system compatibility or outdated SplashKit versions.

:::

## Problem

When attempting to run a program that uses SplashKit on MacOS, you may encounter the following error message: `System.DllNotFoundException unable to load DLL splashkit.dll`.

## Solutions

### Ensure macOS is Updated

Update your macOS to the latest version available. Ideally, your OS should be version **12.0** or later, as compatibility issues with `splashkit.dll` are less likely on recent versions of macOS.

---

### For Older macOS Versions (Pre-12.0)

If you are using a version of macOS older than 12.0, you can revert SplashKit to a previous version that may be more compatible with your system. Run the following commands in Terminal, one line at a time:

```shell
cd ~/.splashkit
```

```shell
git fetch --unshallow
```

```shell
git checkout cbb68dc
```

**Note**: After these commands, using `skm dotnet new` might affect the structure of SplashKit project files. Instead, you can use this [Template SplashKit Project](https://deakin365-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/o_mckeon_deakin_edu_au/EZWAVnpc1QxHqFB7KbZ-j_sBreJCSEJLomdDUKsnT7DykA?e=EKefqK) (*zipped folder*) for creating new projects.

### Instructions

<Steps>

1. Unzip the downloaded template.
2. Read the “`README.txt`” file for guidance on setting up new projects.
3. Review the `Program.cs` file, which includes a comment to help configure the project. Once set up, you can remove the comment lines.

</Steps>

These steps should help resolve compatibility issues with `splashkit.dll` and ensure that your programs run smoothly.
