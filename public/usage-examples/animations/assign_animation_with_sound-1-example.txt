Assign Animation (in-script + sound) — switch an Animation to a named animation inside its current script and optionally play first-frame audio

This demonstrates `assign_animation(anim, "WalkFront", true)` where the `Animation` is already using an animation script and will optionally play a sound attached to the starting frame.

To test locally:
