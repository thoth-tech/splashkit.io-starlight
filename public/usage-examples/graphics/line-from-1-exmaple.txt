# Lines From Rectangle Example

This example demonstrates how to use the `LinesFrom` function to retrieve the edges of a rectangle and interact with them using the mouse.

The program draws a rectangle in the center of the screen and obtains its edges as individual lines using SplashKit’s `LinesFrom(Rectangle)` function. Each edge is displayed in a different color.

A key enhancement in this example is the addition of **mouse hover detection**. When the user moves the mouse pointer over any of the rectangle’s edges, that edge highlights with a thicker and brighter color. This provides an interactive and visual way to explore what the `LinesFrom` function does.

## Function Demonstrated

`LinesFrom(Rectangle rect)`  
Returns a list of 4 lines representing the edges of the rectangle: top, right, bottom, and left.

## Effectiveness and Usefulness

The example goes beyond a static demonstration by simulating a real-world interactive scenario. This makes it easy for developers to understand:

- How `LinesFrom` breaks a rectangle into lines.
- How to access and individually interact with each line.
- How this can be used for hover effects, selection zones, or collision detection in games and UI systems.

This dynamic interaction highlights the practical use of `LinesFrom` in game and graphics development with SplashKit.

## Visual Aid
