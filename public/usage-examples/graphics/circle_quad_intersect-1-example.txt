Title: Circle Quad Intersect

Description:
This example shows how to use the `CircleQuadIntersect` function to detect when a circle intersects with a quad.

A white circle follows the mouse cursor. A green quad is drawn in the center of the screen. When the circle overlaps the quad, the quad turns red. This makes it easy to visualise how the `CircleQuadIntersect` function behaves.

Function Demonstrated:
- CircleQuadIntersect
