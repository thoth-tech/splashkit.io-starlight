## Description

Ping Pong is a fast-paced, C++-based game developed using the Splashkit SDK, inspired by the rules of Air Hockey. Designed for an HD screen resolution of 1280x720, it pits two players against each other in a competitive match where the cursor moves horizontally.

The game features a football-themed background and includes boundary obstacles, a centrally-spawning ball with random angles and speeds, and player assets designed as cursors or blocks. Key functionalities include collision detection, scoring, and in-game physics to ensure a dynamic and engaging gameplay experience.

Extensive testing and debugging were conducted to refine the game, resulting in a polished final design with enhanced visual appeal through Canva backgrounds. Enjoy a classic arcade experience with modern design in Ping Pong!
