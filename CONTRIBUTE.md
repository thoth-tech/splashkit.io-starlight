## Website Guide

<!-- TODO: Update the information below -->

This guide provides information on the structure and organization of the SplashKit website using the Starlight framework. Follow these instructions to navigate through the project and make necessary updates.

### Installation and Commands

For basic installation and commands, please refer to the [`Readme.md`](/README.md) file in the project's root directory.

### Image Resources

All image resources are located under the `public` root directory.

### Documentation Pages

Documentation pages are stored under `root/src/content/docs/`. To find information on specific SplashKit components such as Animations, Sounds, etc., refer to the respective sections within the `components` directory.

Each working directory can contain an `index.mdx` file. This file serves as the page that will be accessed when only the section is fetched. For instance, under the `installation` directory, the `index.mdx` page will be accessed when `https://some-host/installation/` is fetched.

### CSS Files

CSS files can be found under `src/styles/`. If you create a new directory or use new style files, update the `astro.config.mjs` file in the root directory to read the files.

### Test Directory

Inside the `test` directory, you will find a NodeJS script that generates MDX pages required for component generation. Refer to the comments inside the script for detailed instructions on usage and customization.

Make sure to follow these guidelines to maintain a well-organized and functional SplashKit website powered by the Starlight framework.
