This project demonstrates the function: add_column_relative(double width)

Purpose:
- Visually simulate a UI layout where columns increase in width by percentage.
- The container is represented as 50 characters wide in the console.

How It Works:
- 0.2 = 20% of the container width → 10 characters
- 1.0 = 100% of the container width → 50 characters
- A bar of '=' symbols visually represents this.

Languages Included:
- C++: Uses standard I/O and string manipulation
- C#: Provided both top-level (minimal) and OOP formats
- Python: Uses a for-loop and basic string multiplication

All implementations show the same output:
[==========] 20%
[====================] 40%
[==============================] 60%
[========================================] 80%
[==================================================] 100%
