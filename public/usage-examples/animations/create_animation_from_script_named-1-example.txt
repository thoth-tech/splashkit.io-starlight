Create Animation (from script name) — create an Animation using a script name and an animation identifier

This example shows how to use `create_animation(script_name, "WalkFront")` — it looks up the animation script by its registered name and creates an Animation using the named animation within that script. Optionally this can play the audio for the starting frame.
