:::caution[Stack Overflow Exception When Opening GUI Application in WSL]

This guide addresses a Stack Overflow Exception encountered when trying to open a GUI application within the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). This issue typically arises when the necessary vGPU driver for running Linux GUI applications in WSL is missing.

:::

## Problem

When attempting to launch a Linux GUI application in WSL, a Stack Overflow Exception error may occur due to compatibility or driver issues, preventing the app from running correctly.

2. **Install the Appropriate vGPU Driver**

   Install the correct virtual GPU (vGPU) driver for your system to enable support for Linux GUI applications in WSL. Select the driver that matches your hardware:

   - [Intel Graphics Driver](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download/19344/intel-graphics-windows-dch-drivers.html)
   - [AMD Graphics Driver](https://www.amd.com/en/support/download/drivers.html)
   - [NVIDIA Graphics Driver](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us)

</Steps>

For further details, consult Microsoftâ€™s guide on [Running Linux GUI Apps on the Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/gui-apps).

Following these steps should resolve the Stack Overflow Exception and allow you to successfully run GUI applications within WSL.
