 What the Program Shows on Screen
When you run this program, the output window displays:
- A game window titled “Sprite Switcher”, sized 800×600 pixels.
- A character image (either player1.png or player2.png) appears at the center of the screen.
- You can move the character using the arrow keys (↑ ↓ ← →).

Pressing:
- Key 1 will switch the character to player1.png
- Key 2 will switch to player2.png
A helpful instructional message is also drawn at the top of the screen:

"Use arrow keys to move. Press 1 or 2 to switch characters."
 What I Learned from This
Through building and running this project, I learned several key things:
- How to load and display images dynamically in a game using SplashKit.
- How to move a character using keyboard input.
- How to switch sprites based on user input at runtime.
- How to manage resources (like clearing previous sprites using free_all_sprites()).
The difference between bitmaps and sprites:
A bitmap is a static image.
A sprite can have position, movement (velocity), and animation.
How to write this logic in C++, C# (top-level and OOP), and Python, gaining experience across multiple programming languages.
