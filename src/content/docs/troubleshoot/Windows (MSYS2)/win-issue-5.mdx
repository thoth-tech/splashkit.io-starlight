This guide helps resolve the error `dotnet: command not found` on Windows. This issue typically occurs when the system PATH does not include the .NET SDK directory.

## Problem

When trying to use the `dotnet` command in the terminal, you may see an error indicating that the command is not found. This is usually due to a missing .NET SDK path in the system PATH environment variable.

## Solution

To resolve this, add the .NET SDK folder to your system PATH.

### Update Your System PATH Variable

After completing those steps, return here to add the specific .NET SDK path.

<Steps>

1. Open the **Edit environment variable** window.
2. Click **New** (red box) to add a new entry.

</Steps>

### Restart MINGW64 Terminal

- Click **OK** on all open windows to save the changes.
- Open a **new** MINGW64 terminal window and try running the `dotnet` command again.

Following these steps should make the `dotnet` command available, allowing you to run .NET applications on Windows without further issues.
