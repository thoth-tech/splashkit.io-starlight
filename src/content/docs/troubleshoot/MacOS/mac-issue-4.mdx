### 2: Add SplashKit PATH to .zshrc file manually

To resolve this, add the `.splashkit` folder to your `.zshrc` file. Follow the steps below:

<Steps>

1. **Locate Your `.zshrc` File**

    The `.zshrc` file is located in your home directory at `~/Users/(your username)/`.

    If you don’t see it, press **Shift + Command + . (dot)** to toggle hidden files visibility in Finder.

2. **Identify Your Username (Optional)**
  
    To ensure you’re in the correct directory, you can use the `whoami` command in Terminal to check your username:

     ```shell
     whoami
     ```

3. **Add SplashKit to PATH**
  
    Open the `.zshrc` file with a text editor and add the following line at the end to include the SplashKit path:

     ```shell
     export PATH="$HOME/.splashkit:$PATH"
     ```

4. **Apply Changes**

    Save the `.zshrc` file and then reload it with the following command to apply changes immediately:

     ```shell
     source ~/.zshrc
     ```

</Steps>

After completing these steps, your terminal should recognize the `skm` command, and you should be able to use SplashKit as expected.
