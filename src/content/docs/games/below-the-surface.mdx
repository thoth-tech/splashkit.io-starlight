## Description

In Below the Surface, the once-immaculate city of Thoth faces an unseen threat. For over a century, Thoth—a futuristic haven renowned for its talented citizens—has been free from the perils of flooding, thanks to advanced systems designed to manage stormwater and sewage. However, beneath the city’s pristine surface, a dire situation unfolds.

The pipes responsible for managing Thoth’s water infrastructure have either malfunctioned or vanished, leading to dangerous flooding that threatens the city's safety. To protect the citizens and avoid public panic, the city's leaders have kept this crisis under wraps, enlisting a select group of elite water company workers for a high-stakes mission.

As a skilled technician, you must venture into the treacherous underground world of Thoth. Navigate through a maze of broken pipes, hazardous conditions, and hidden dangers. Your goal is to repair the damaged infrastructure, restore the city's safety, and uncover the mystery behind the missing pipes.

In this thrilling platform game, you'll need to master precise jumps, solve intricate puzzles, and avoid deadly obstacles to ensure Thoth remains the beacon of prosperity it’s known to be. Dive into the depths, fix what’s broken, and save the city before it's too late!
