## Description

This PR updates the **geometry usage examples and documentation** in SplashKit to improve clarity, consistency, and functionality. It includes:

- Improved code samples for geometric shapes (rectangles, circles, triangles, etc.)
- Enhanced documentation for point, vector, and shape operations
- More practical examples for geometric calculations and collision detection
- Consistent formatting and style across geometry documentation
- Verified mathematical accuracy for all geometry-related operations

These changes aim to assist developers in better understanding and utilizing SplashKit's geometry functionality, especially for game development and graphics programming.
