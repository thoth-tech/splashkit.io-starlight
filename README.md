    â”œâ”€â”€ assets/
    â”œâ”€â”€ components/
    â”œâ”€â”€ content/
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ docs/
    â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ api/
    â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ guides/

    â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ troubleshoot/

â”œâ”€â”€ astro.config.mjs

Starlight looks for `.md` or `.mdx` files in the `src/content/docs/` directory. Each file is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Images can be added to `src/assets/` and embedded in Markdown with a relative link.

Static assets, like favicons and gifs, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
