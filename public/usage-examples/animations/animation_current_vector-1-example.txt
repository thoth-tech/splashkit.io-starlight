Animation Current Vector — Read the vector for the current frame

Short example showing how to retrieve the 2D vector attached to the current frame of an Animation.

:::note
This example uses the `explosion.txt` animation resource (part of the example resources) which contains `v:` vector entries.
The verification runner below parses `explosion.txt` and extracts the first vector entry for demonstration.

Resources: /usage-examples/animations/Resources/animations/explosion.txt

Run the verification runner locally without SplashKit:

```powershell
py -3 public/usage-examples/animations/animation_current_vector-1-example-runner.py public/usage-examples/animations/Resources/animations/explosion.txt
```
