## Gameplay
        
In Runner Dash, players navigate a dynamic grid using an arcade machine's joystick to collect gems and avoid a relentless enemy. The goal is to gather as many gems as possible while dodging the enemy that chases you whenever you move. Each collected gem is replaced by a new gem appearing at a random location on the screen. The game continues endlessly, with the only way to lose being a collision with the enemy.
