Animation Count — Count animations in a script

Simple example showing how to count the number of animations in an AnimationScript.

:::note
This example loads a named animation script (e.g. "WalkingScript") and prints how many animations it contains.
To actually run this example you need the animation script resource files (the repo's guides refer to `kermit.txt` as an example script).
:::

Resources: /usage-examples/animations/animation_count-1-example-resources.zip

To quickly verify this example locally without installing SplashKit, there's a simple verification script included in the example folder:

```powershell
py -3 public/usage-examples/animations/animation_count-1-example-runner.py public/usage-examples/animations/Resources/animations/kermit.txt
```

The runner will print the number of animations found in the script (lines starting with `i:`).
