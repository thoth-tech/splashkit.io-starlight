## Gameplay
        
In Solo mode, players control their car with the joystick, navigating left and right to avoid slower vehicles. Colliding with obstacles reduces lives, and the game ends when all lives are lost. Accelerating boosts speed, but without it, the car drifts downward. At max speed, the car cannot navigate past screen edges. 

 In Cooperative mode, two players work together, facing the same obstacles. Each player's life count decreases with collisions, and the game ends if either player loses all their lives. 

 The game ends when all lives are lost due to collisions with obstacles. Players win by successfully navigating all obstacles within the target time.
