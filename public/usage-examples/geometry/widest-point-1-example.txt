Program: Widest Points on a Circle Along a Vector

Description:
This program calculates and displays the two widest points on a circle along a vector that extends from the circleâ€™s center to the mouse position (the external point). As you move the mouse, the direction vector is updated, and the widest points are recalculated in real time.
