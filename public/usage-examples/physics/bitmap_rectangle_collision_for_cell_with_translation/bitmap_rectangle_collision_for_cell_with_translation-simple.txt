#### Test Bitmap Collision with a Rectangle Given a Translation Matrix

Tests if a bitmap cell drawn using a passed in translation matrix will intersect with a rectangle. You can use this to detect collisions between bitmaps and rectangles.

Uses the [bitmap_rectangle_collision](/api/physics/#bitmap-rectangle-collision-3) function.
