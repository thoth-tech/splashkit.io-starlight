## 4. Storage and Security of Information

Your data is stored securely on servers compliant with modern security standards. We implement
reasonable safeguards to protect your information from misuse, interference, loss, unauthorised
access, modification, or disclosure. Data processed through Google Analytics is transmitted securely
using HTTPS encryption and stored on servers adhering to robust privacy and security standards,
including compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other relevant privacy
laws. While Google Analytics implements stringent security measures, it is important to note that
data stored on its platform is subject to Google’s data policies and may be accessible to Google
under certain circumstances. We are committed to ensuring that our use of Google Analytics complies
with applicable data protection laws and prioritises the security and privacy of your data.

## 5. Disclosure of Information

We do not disclose personal information to third parties unless required to do so under Australian
law, such as in response to a legal obligation or regulatory requirement, or unless you have
explicitly authorised such disclosure. If it becomes necessary to disclose personal information to
recipients located outside Australia, we will ensure that the disclosure complies with the
Australian Privacy Principles (APPs). This includes taking reasonable steps to ensure that the
overseas recipient handles your personal information in a way that is consistent with Australian
privacy standards. Where practical, we will notify you of the countries in which these recipients
are likely to be located and the nature of the data being disclosed. Our priority is to maintain the
integrity and security of your personal information, regardless of where it is processed or stored.

## 6. Access and Correction of Information

You have the right to access and correct any personal information we hold about you. To request
access or a correction, please contact us at thoth.tech.deakin@gmail.com. We will respond to your
request within a reasonable timeframe.

## 7. Complaints

If you believe we have breached the APPs, you can lodge a complaint by contacting us at
thoth.tech.deakin@gmail.com. We take privacy concerns seriously and will respond promptly to address
your complaint.

---

## 8. Cross-Border Disclosure

While we primarily store data within Australia, there may be circumstances where data needs to be
disclosed to recipients in other countries, such as when using international cloud storage
providers, analytics tools like Google Analytics, or engaging overseas-based technical support. If
such disclosure is necessary, we will inform you where practical and take all reasonable steps to
ensure that your personal information is handled securely and in accordance with the Australian
Privacy Principles (APPs), including ensuring that overseas recipients provide similar privacy
protections.

---

## 9. Security Disclaimer

While we strive to protect your data using robust security measures, it is important to note that
transmissions over the internet are not entirely secure and may be subject to risks beyond our
control. Although we take all reasonable steps to safeguard your information, we cannot guarantee
absolute security during transmission and disclaim liability for any data breaches caused by factors
such as cyberattacks, technical failures, or other circumstances beyond our direct control.

---

## 10. Children’s Privacy

We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 13 without verifiable parental
consent. If we become aware that we have inadvertently collected personal information from a child
under 13 without such consent, we will take immediate steps to delete the information from our
records. Parents or guardians who believe their child has provided us with personal information
without their consent are encouraged to contact us so we can promptly address the issue

---

## 11. Updates to This Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated periodically to reflect changes in our practices or Australian
legal requirements. The latest version will always be available on our website.
