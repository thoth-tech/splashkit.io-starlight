:::caution[`System.DllNotFoundException unable to load DLL splashkit.dll`]

This guide provides solutions for Windows users encountering the `System.DllNotFoundException` error when trying to run a SplashKit program. This error typically occurs when the `splashkit.dll` file is missing or not correctly linked to the project.

:::

## Problem

When attempting to run a SplashKit program, you may see an error message: `System.DllNotFoundException unable to load DLL splashkit.dll`. This issue may stem from antivirus interference, path configuration, or project setup.

## Solutions

### Disable Antivirus Software Temporarily

Some antivirus programs may block `splashkit.dll`. Temporarily disable your antivirus software and try running the program again.

---

### Avoid Naming Conflicts

Ensure your project name is not "SplashKit," as this can cause conflicts. Rename the project folder if necessary.

 ---

### Use the Correct Terminal and Folder Setup

- Open the **MINGW64** terminal, not the MSYS terminal, to create your project files.
- Ensure the project files are located in their own dedicated folder to avoid any path or configuration issues.

---

### Manually Add `splashkit.dll` to Your System PATH

To ensure Windows can locate `splashkit.dll`, manually add its directory to your PATH environment variable:

- Follow steps 1–3 in the “Update your system PATH variable” section [here](/troubleshoot/windows-msys2/win-issue-7).
- Return to this guide and continue with the instructions below.

#### Next Step

- In the “Edit environment variable” window, ensure the following paths are added to your PATH, similar to the example in the green box below:

- If any of the paths are missing, click **New** (red box) and add the missing path. Adjust it to match your own username.
- Once added, click **OK** in all windows, open a **new** MINGW64 terminal, and try running the program again.

### Copy SplashKit Binaries to Your Build Output Folder (Last Resort)

If all else fails, try manually copying the SplashKit binaries to your project’s build output directory:

<Steps>

 1. Navigate to the folder containing SplashKit binaries at `C:\msys64\home\(your username)\.splashkit\lib\win64`.

       *Replace "(your username)" with your actual username (you can use the `whoami` command in the terminal to confirm your username).*

       Your folder contents should look similar to this:

 2. Copy all files from this folder into your project’s build output directory, which is typically located at:

       `<Project folder name>\bin\Debug\net7.0`

       For example, if your project folder is named "MyProject" and uses .NET 7.0, the path would be:

       `MyProject\bin\Debug\net7.0`

       **Note:** If you’re using a different .NET version, adjust the path accordingly.

 </Steps>

Following these steps should help resolve the `System.DllNotFoundException` error and allow your program to locate `splashkit.dll` properly.
