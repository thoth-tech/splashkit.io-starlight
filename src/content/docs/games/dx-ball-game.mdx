## Description

The brick breakout game is a modern reimagining of the classic arcade games "DX-Ball" and "Breakout," developed using C++ and the SplashKit SDK to showcase the framework's capabilities. Players control a paddle to bounce a ball and break bricks on the screen, advancing through four levels of increasing difficulty. Each level introduces new challenges, such as single collision bricks, dual collision bricks, and hidden bricks that become visible upon contact. The game features power-ups, like multiple balls and score multipliers, to enhance gameplay, while collision detection and physics-based ball movement create an engaging and dynamic experience. The project is designed to help future developers understand game development fundamentals and to explore SplashKit's versatility on various platforms, including Raspberry Pi and arcade machines.

## Gameplay

The game is a clone of the classic arcade games "DX-Ball" and "Breakout," where the player controls a paddle at the bottom of the screen to prevent a bouncing ball from falling out of bounds. The main objective is to break all the bricks on the screen by directing the ball towards them. The player advances through four levels, each introducing new brick types and increasing difficulty. These bricks vary in strength, requiring multiple hits to break or appearing as hidden until struck by the ball. The game incorporates power-ups like multiple balls and score multipliers to aid the player, adding strategic depth to the gameplay. As the player progresses, they must use their skills to clear each level, leveraging the unique properties of different bricks and power-ups to achieve the highest score possible.
