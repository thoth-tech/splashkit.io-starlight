This example demonstrates how to use the SplashKit function `bitmap_name()`.

The program loads a bitmap from a file, retrieves its assigned name using the `bitmap_name()` function, and displays both the image and its name. The image is centered in the window, and the name is printed to the terminal.

This function is helpful when debugging or when working with dynamically managed image resources, allowing developers to confirm the identity of loaded bitmaps during runtime.

The example includes implementations in C++, Python, and C# (both top-level and OOP).
